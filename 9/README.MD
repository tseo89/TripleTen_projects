# Machine Learning in Business: Oil Well Investment Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a machine learning project focused on determining the optimal region for oil well development based on predictive models and financial analysis.

## Overview

The project aims to identify the most lucrative region for investing in oil well development using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, predictive modeling using linear regression, financial calculations, and risk assessment.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains synthetic data for three different regions (Region 0, Region 1, Region 2).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis and modeling process.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and profit calculations.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for the project.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the synthetic data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the features and distributions within each region.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing linear regression models for each region to predict oil well reserves.
4. **Financial Calculations**: Calculating potential revenue, profit, and risk of losses for each region.
5. **Bootstrap Analysis**: Utilizing bootstrapping to derive distributions of profit and risk assessments.

## Findings

- **Region Analysis**: Detailed insights into each region's potential profit, risk factors, and confidence intervals.
- **Investment Recommendation**: Recommendations based on the analysis for the most viable region to invest in.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the notebooks or source code folders for specific analysis steps.
3. Run the code cells or scripts in a Python environment.
