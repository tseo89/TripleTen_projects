# Sure Tomorrow Insurance Machine Learning Project

Sure Tomorrow Insurance company aims to leverage machine learning for several tasks related to customer analysis and prediction. This project addresses the following tasks:

## Task 1: Customer Similarity Analysis

Identify customers similar to a given customer to assist marketing efforts.

## Task 2: Insurance Benefit Prediction

Develop a prediction model to determine whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit and evaluate its performance against a dummy model.

## Task 3: Insurance Benefit Count Prediction

Build a linear regression model to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.

## Task 4: Data Masking for Privacy Protection

Develop a data transformation algorithm (data masking or obfuscation) to protect clients' data while maintaining model quality.

## Task 5: Linear Regression with Obfuscation
Prove that Linear Regression works computationally with obfuscation transformation. 

## Project Instructions
