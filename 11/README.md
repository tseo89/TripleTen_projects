# Sure Tomorrow Insurance Machine Learning Project
## Project Description
Sure Tomorrow Insurance company aims to leverage machine learning for several tasks related to customer analysis and prediction. This project addresses the following tasks:

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Customer Similarity Analysis

Identify customers similar to a given customer to assist marketing efforts. Define function that returns k nearest neighbors for an $n^{th}$ object based on a specified distance metric. We'll explore how the kNN algorithm will be impacted by scaling. Also, we will also explore similarity between the Manhattan distance metric. 

### Task 2: Insurance Benefit Prediction

Develop a prediction model to determine whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit and evaluate its performance against a dummy model. 

### Task 3: Insurance Benefit Count Prediction

Build a linear regression model to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.

### Task 4: Data Masking for Privacy Protection

Develop a data transformation algorithm (data masking or obfuscation) to protect clients' data while maintaining model quality.
