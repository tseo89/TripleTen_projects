# Sure Tomorrow Insurance Machine Learning Project

Sure Tomorrow insurance company aims to leverage machine learning for several tasks related to customer analysis and prediction. This project addresses the following tasks:

## Task 1: Customer Similarity Analysis

Identify customers similar to a given customer to assist marketing efforts.

## Task 2: Insurance Benefit Prediction

Develop a prediction model to determine whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit and evaluate its performance against a dummy model.

## Task 3: Insurance Benefit Count Prediction

Build a linear regression model to predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive.

## Task 4: Data Masking for Privacy Protection

Develop a data transformation algorithm (data masking or obfuscation) to protect clients' personal data while maintaining model quality.

## Project Instructions

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from `/datasets/insurance_us.csv`.

2. **Data Quality Check**: Ensure the dataset is clean without missing values or extreme outliers.

3. **Task Implementation**:
   - Task 1: Implement customer similarity analysis.
   - Task 2: Develop and evaluate an insurance benefit prediction model.
   - Task 3: Build and assess a linear regression model for benefit count prediction.
   - Task 4: Implement data masking technique to protect personal data.

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Follow the provided project template and complete necessary code sections.
   - Keep the code organized, neat, and well-documented.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Ensure all tasks are completed according to instructions.
   - Follow project structure guidelines.
   - Present findings and conclusions based on project experience.

## Data Description
