Introduction
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for the Yandex.Music project, where we analyze user behavior and music preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville using real Yandex.Music data. The project focuses on testing three hypotheses related to user activity, genre preferences, and more.

Stage 3: Testing the Hypotheses
Conclusions
Stage 1: Data Overview
In this stage, we provide an initial overview of the data stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv. We aim to understand the quality of the data and identify any potential issues that may need to be addressed.

Conclusions
At the end of this stage, we will summarize our findings regarding the quality of the data.

Stage 2: Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for hypothesis testing. In this stage, we will address various data quality issues, including header style, missing values, and duplicates.

2.1 Header Style
We will ensure that the headers of the dataset follow a consistent and clean style for easier analysis.

2.2 Missing Values
We will handle missing values in a manner that ensures the dataset's integrity.

2.3 Duplicates
Duplicate data entries can skew our analysis, so we will identify and deal with duplicates.

2.4 Conclusions
At the end of this stage, we will provide conclusions regarding the data preprocessing efforts.

Stage 3: Testing the Hypotheses
The core of the project involves testing three hypotheses related to user activity, music preferences, and more. We will use the preprocessed data to analyze and test these hypotheses.

3.1 Hypothesis 1: User Activity
We will test whether user activity varies based on the day of the week and the city, specifically comparing Springfield and Shelbyville.

3.2 Hypothesis 2: Music Preferences on Monday and Friday
This hypothesis aims to determine if there are differences in music preferences between Springfield and Shelbyville residents on Monday mornings and Friday evenings.

3.3 Hypothesis 3: Genre Preferences
We will investigate genre preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville and identify any significant differences.

Findings
We will summarize our findings and conclusions based on the results of hypothesis testing.

Conclusion
This project focuses on understanding user behavior and music preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville using real Yandex.Music data. By following the stages of data overview, data preprocessing, and hypothesis testing, we aim to draw meaningful insights and conclusions regarding the three hypotheses.
